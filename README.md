# scistudio-package-lcms

A GitHub **template repository** for building a new
[SciStudio](https://github.com/jiazhenz026/SciStudio) package. It ships a
minimal but complete example package plus the governance every package
should have: CI (lint, type, test, wheel build, contract check), an
`AGENTS.md` + PR checklist, and a documentation standard.

The conventions follow `scistudio-blocks-spectroscopy`, the reference package.

## Use this template

1. On GitHub, click **Use this template → Create a new repository**. Name it
   `scistudio-blocks-<domain>`.
2. Add the repository secret **`SCISTUDIO_CORE_TOKEN`** (Settings → Secrets and
   variables → Actions). It needs read access to the private `scistudio` core
   repo so CI can install it. Until core is on PyPI, every block repo needs
   this secret.
3. Rename the package to your domain:
   - `src/scistudio_blocks_lcms/` → `src/scistudio_blocks_<domain>/`
   - In `pyproject.toml`: `[project].name`, the three `[project.entry-points...]`
     references, `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel].packages`, and
     `known-first-party`.
   - Update `__init__.py` imports and `PackageInfo`.
4. Replace the example type/block/previewer with your own, and **fill in the
   MUST skeletons**: the type's `from_<domain>(...)` constructor and
   `describe_public_api()` raise `NotImplementedError` until you implement them
   (ADR-052 §13.3), so a half-finished package fails loudly instead of shipping
   a partial contract.
5. Fill in `README.md`, `docs/package-overview.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` to
   `docs/DOCUMENTATION-STANDARD.md`.

## Governance in one breath

- No gate ledger, no multi-step workflow. The gate is the PR checklist
  (`.github/pull_request_template.md`) enforced by CI.
- Every PR closes an issue, adds/updates tests for behavior changes, and keeps
  docs to the standard.
- `python scripts/validate_contract.py` + `scistudio blocks` prove the package
  still installs into core. CI runs both.

## The developer-facing contract (ADR-052 §13)

A package exposes two surfaces: a **registration surface** to core (the three
entry points) and a **reuse surface** to authors — the types, their
constructors, and the inherited accessors someone imports to write their own
block, plot, or script. This template makes the reuse surface
**self-enforcing**, so a scaffolded package is correct-by-construction:

- **MUST members ship as skeletons that raise until implemented.** A type's
  domain-native constructor (here `LCMSFeatureTable.from_elmaven(...)`, now
  implemented) and `describe_public_api()` (the discovery hook, still a
  skeleton) raise `NotImplementedError` until filled in.
- **SHOULD members ship as empty placeholders.** `helpers.py` is the home for
  optional public cross-type helpers — fill it in or leave it empty.
- **Every public symbol carries a stability marker.** `@stable` / `@provisional`
  + a `Since` against *this package's* version line (`scistudio.stability`,
  ADR-052 §5), read back by the contract check and the generated API reference.
- **`scripts/validate_contract.py` enforces it.** Beyond the entry-point
  handshake it checks the §13.1 reuse surface: public types at the top level, no
  `to_pandas` / `to_numpy` shadowing, no underscore-named author-facing helpers,
  and a stability marker on every public symbol. CI runs it.

The authoritative contract is the core spec
(`docs/specs/adr-052-public-api-surface.md` §13) and ADR-052; this template
models it. Your package transcribes its own §13.1 table into
`docs/package-overview.md`.

## Develop the example locally

```bash
pip install "scistudio @ git+https://github.com/jiazhenz026/SciStudio.git@main"
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
scistudio blocks   # the example block should appear
```
